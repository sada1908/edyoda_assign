Question,Input,Feedback
"Python lists are immutable, right?",I am not sure,"It's great that you're honest about not being sure. In Python, lists are actually mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created. It's a key concept to understand in Python programming. Keep up the good work in being open to learning and asking questions!"
Define the universe in Python syntax.,Python is an Universal Language,"The learner's response is incorrect. The universe in Python syntax refers to the set of all possible objects that can exist in a Python program. This includes variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. 

Constructive feedback: The universe in Python syntax refers to the set of all possible objects that can exist in a Python program. It is not related to Python being a universal language. Please provide a more accurate definition in the future."
dfjjklsdfjklsdf,This is wonderful verse,It seems like there may have been a misunderstanding or mistake in your response. Can you please provide a more accurate answer or explanation? Remember to read the question carefully and try your best to provide a relevant response. Keep up the effort!
What's the best way to time travel using Python?,No time is best to travel sing Python,"The response is not accurate or clear. It seems like there may have been a misunderstanding of the question. To time travel using Python, you can use the datetime module to manipulate dates and times. It's important to pay attention to the details of the question and provide a relevant and accurate response. Keep practicing and don't be afraid to ask for clarification if needed."
I don't know but it has something to do with loops?,Loops are used in Programming language,"Your response is partially correct. It's good that you mentioned loops are used in programming languages, but it would be helpful to provide more specific information about how loops are used and their purpose in this context. Try to elaborate on the different types of loops and how they can be used to repeat a certain block of code multiple times. Keep up the good work!"
Tuple is a kind of fruit or data structure?,Tuple is a type of list in Python,"The learner's response is partially accurate. A tuple is a data structure in Python, not a type of list. A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning its values cannot be changed after it is created. It is commonly used to store related pieces of information together. Try to provide a more accurate definition in your explanation. Keep it up!"
List comprehension... is that a meditation thing?,I do no think List COmprehension is a meditation thing,"Your response is clear and correct. List comprehension is not a meditation practice, but rather a concise way to create lists in Python. Good job!"
import love; send(hugs) to('everyone'),This is a kind of Python Library,"Great start! However, the code seems to be more of a pseudo code or a fun message rather than actual Python code. Remember to provide a more accurate explanation and code when responding to technical questions. Keep up the good work!"
"You know this better than me, you tell me!",I cannot,"Your response is not clear. Can you please provide more context or clarify your answer? Remember, it's okay to ask for more information or clarification if needed."
"I think it means like, you know, when Python breathes?",I cannot tell when Python Breathes,"It seems like you are unsure about what ""Python breathes"" means. In Python, ""breathing"" refers to the process of executing code line by line. It's important to have a clear understanding of basic programming concepts to build a strong foundation in Python. Keep practicing and learning to improve your understanding. Keep up the good effort!"
